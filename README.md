## Why are Employees Dissatisfied?
In this project, I cleaned and analyzed exit surveys from employees of the Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) body of the Queensland government in Australia. The TAFE exit survey can be found here and the survey for the DETE can be found here.

I combined the results for both surveys to answer the following questions:
1. Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction?
2. What about employees who have been there longer?
3. How many people in each career stage resigned due to some kind of dissatisfaction?
4. Did more employees in the DETE survey or TAFE survey end their employment because they were dissatisfied in some way?

### Summary of Results
1. More employees in DETE survey end their employment because they were dissatisfied in some way as compared to employees in TAFE survey. While it might also appear like employees of the DETE institute might be more likely to resign reporting dissatisfaction, we also need to consider that there were more survey answers corresponding to a 'dissatisfied' outcome in the DETE survey. 
2. Experienced (3-7 years) and new employees (<3 years) have less percentage of dissatisfaction. Hence, they are less likely to leave as compared to Established and Veteran employees who are more dissatisfied. Most dissatisfied employees are Veterans (11 years).
3. Overall (TAFE and DETE combined), not many people moved to the private sector after resigning. But many people resigned due to lack of work life balance and recognition.
4. Established employees have an overall low rate of resignation which is almost similar for lack of work-life balance, recognition and moving to private sector.
5. Established employees have an overall low rate of resignation which is almost similar for all three reasons. We can see that Experienced people are resigning and moving to the private sector, while most newly joined employees (which is surprising) and veterans are leaving due to lack of work-life balance. We can also see that very few veterans are resigning to move to private sector which makes sense because they are settled and wouldn't want to start something new.
6. Veterans are exiting due to lack of work life balance and lack of recognition.
